// component -> component instances -> react elements -> DOM elements

// how rendering works

// when state updates, react re-renders the component
// render is triggered
// render phase

// in react, rendering is not updating the dom or displaying elements on the screen.
// rendering is the process of updating the virtual dom, it does not produced visual changes.

// after render phase commit phase starts
// commit phase
// react compares the virtual dom with the real dom and updates the real dom with the changes
// react actually writes to the DOM, updating, inserting and deleting elements

// browser notince DOM has been updated and re-paints the screen

// the two situations that trigger renders
// 1. initial render of the appplication
// 2. state is updated in one or more component instances (re-rendering)

// the render process is triggered for the entire application
// react looks enter the entire tree before it starts to render
// react starts at the root component and works its way down the tree
// react will render all the components in the tree
// renders are not triggered immediately, but scheduled for when the JS engine has some free time
// there is also batching of multiple setState calls in event handlers

// virtual dom
// tree of all react elements crated from all instances of all components tree
// virtual dom is a representation of the real dom
// virtual dom is a tree of react elements
// react elements are plain JS objects
// react elements are lightweight and cheap to create
// react elements are immutable
// react elements are not the same as DOM elements
// react elements are not the same as component instances
// react elements are not the same as components

// shadow dom
// shadow dom is used in stuff like web components
// shadow dom is a browser feature
// shadow dom is a tree of DOM elements
// shadow dom is a way to encapsulate DOM elements
// shadow dom is a way to create components in the browser
// shadow dom is a way to create custom elements in the browser
// shadow dom is a way to create web components
// shadow dom is a way to create reusable components
// shadow dom is a way to create components with their own styles
// shadow dom is a way to create components with their own markup
// shadow dom is a way to create components with their own behavior
// shadow dom is a way to create components with their own lifecycle
// shadow dom is a way to create components with their own state
// shadow dom is a way to create components with their own events
// shadow dom is a way to create components with their own API
// shadow dom is a way to create components with their own children

// rendering a component will cause all of its child components
// to render as well (no matter if props changed or not)

// necessary because react doesn't know whether children will be affected by the change
// new virual dom is created and compared to the old virtual dom
// if there are differences, the real dom is updated
// the process is known as reconciliation or diffing
// it is done by using fiber data structure

// virual dom + reconciliation + fiber = react

// reconcillation decides which dom elements actually need to be updated
// inserted, deleted in order to reflect the latest state changes
// current reconciller in the react is known as fiber reconciller

// fibre tree are never destroyed, it's a immutable data structure
// fibre tree is created from the virtual dom

// work of fibre tree

// current state
// current props
// side effects
// used hooks
// queues of work

// 1. it keeps track of the changes that need to be made to the dom
// 2. it keeps track of the changes that need to be made to the component instances
// 3. it keeps track of the changes that need to be made to the react elements

// fibre tree follow linked list

// work can be done asynchronously
// rendereing process can be split into chunks, taska can be prioritized and work
// can be paused, aborted or resumed

// enables concurrent features like suspense or transitions
// long renders won't block JS engine

// component instances that triggered re-render +
// react element
// virtual dom
// fibre tree
// reconciller
// updated fibre tree
// list of dom updates
// dom updates
// React writes to the DOM: inserts, deletions, and updates (list of dom updates are "flushed" to the dom)
// committing is synchronous: DOM is updating in one go
// after the commit phase cmpletes, the workinprogress fibre tree becomes the current fibre tree for the next render cycle
// after that browser raises a paint event and the screen is updated
// react dom do all of the dom work not the react library
// we don't use react only for web work
// we can use it for mible applications as well such by using react native library we can build ios and android applications
// with remotion we can create videos with react
// react have different renderer for different platforms
// react dom is the default renderer for web
// react native is the renderer for ios and android
// react three fiber is the renderer for three js
// react art is the renderer for canvas
// react konva is the renderer for canvas
// remotion is the renderer for video
// the commit phase

// how diffing works
// diffing uses two fundamental assumptions
// same position, different element
// same position, same element

/* <div>
  <searchbar/>
</div> */

/* <header>
  <searchbar/>
</header> */

//different dom element
// react assumes entire subtree has changed
// old subtree is unmounted
// new subtree is mounted
// old components are destroyed and removed from dom, including state
// tree might be rebuit if children stayed the same (state is reset)

// if same position, same element
// react assumes nothing has changed
// old subtree is kept
// new subtree is ignored
// old components are kept, including state

// now what if we don't want to keep the state of the component
// we can use key prop to tell react that the component is different
// and it should not keep the state of the component
// special prop that we use to tell the diffing algorithm that the component is different
// allows react to distinguish between different instances of the same component

// when a key between renders, the element will be destroyed and recreated
// event if the position in the tree is the same as before

// using keys to reset state
// keys are not meant to be used to force re-rendering
// why to use key in the list
// if we don't use key in the list, react will use index as key
// if we add or remove an item from the list, react will re-render the entire list
// if we use key, react will only re-render the item that has changed
// different position in the tree, but te key stays the same, so the elements will be kept in the DOM
// whenever you want to reset the state of the compnent just pass key to the component
// key is not a prop, it is a special attribute that react uses internally

// we use two types of logic in react component
// 1. render logic
// cod ethat lives at the top lievel of the component function
// participates in describing how the component view looks like
// executed every time the component renders
// 2. event logic
// executed as a consequence of the event that the handler is listening for
// code that acually does things: update state, perform an http request, read an input field, navigate to another page, etc.
// create as much as pure functions as possible
// pure functions are functions that don't have side effects
// pure functions are functions that don't mutate data
// pure functions are functions that don't have any dependencies on the outside world
// state update batching
// react batches state updates
// react batches state updates that are triggered synchronously
// renders are not triggered immediately, but scheduled for when the JS engine has some free time
// there is also batching of multiple setState calls in event handlers
// jus one render and commit per event handler
// automatic batching at all times, everywhere after react 18+
// timeout, promise and native events are not batched in react 17 but in react 18 they are batched
// we can opt out of automatic batching by wrapping a state update in a ReactDOM.flushSync() call

// each time when we set state based on the previous state we should use callback function
// because react batches state updates, we can't rely on the previous state value
/// batching happens in event handlers as well as promises and timeouts in react 18

// how react handle events
// react uses event delegation
// react attaches a single event listener to the root of the document
// react uses event delegation to listen for events that occur anywhere in the document
// react bundles all the click handlers and applies it to the root of the document
// this is yet antohter important function of fibre tree
// behind the scenes react uses event delegation to listen for events that occur anywhere in the document
// event catpturing going from top to bottom and event bubbling is going from bottom to top
// how these event objects actually work behind the scenes
// event object is a synthetic event object
// synthetic events fix cross browser inconsistencies, so that event works in the exact same way in all browsers
// most synthetic events bubble (including foucs and blur and change) except for scroll
// in react we have to use event.preventDefault() to prevent default behaviour of the event
// we can't simply return false from the event handler
// just add capture to the event listener, to handle event from top to bottom

// react is a library not a framework
// all in one kit is a framework
// separate ingrediet is a library
// Next.js is a framework that is built on top of react
// next.js and remix have http requests and styling and routing and form management included in it
